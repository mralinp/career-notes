# SOLID principle in python:

he SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that aim to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. Each principle focuses on a specific aspect of software design, and together they provide guidelines for creating high-quality object-oriented designs. These principles were coined by Robert C. Martin (often referred to as Uncle Bob) and have become fundamental guidelines for object-oriented design and programming. Here's a brief overview of each principle:

## 1. [S]ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP): 

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility. This principle encourages breaking down complex functionalities into smaller, more manageable parts.

## 2. [O]pen/Closed Principle (OCP): 

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the behavior of a system without modifying its existing code.

## 3. [L]iskov Substitution Principle (LSP): 

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.

## 4. [I]nterface Segregation Principle (ISP): 

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use. This principle advocates for splitting large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones so that clients only need to know about the methods that are relevant to them.

## 5. [D]ependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; rather, details should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes loose coupling between software modules by introducing abstractions and decoupling dependencies.
